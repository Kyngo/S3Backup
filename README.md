# S3 Backup System üíæ

## Installation / Setup

1. Copy all the files in here to `/opt/s3backup` on your machine.
2. Then change the permissions of the scripts so they can be executed, like this: `chmod +x /opt/s3backup/{backup,delete}.sh`.
3. Then `cp /opt/s3backup/credentials.dist /opt/s3backup/credentials`, and then put your AWS programatic credentials and prefered region inside that file.
4. Finally, create a file named `directories` inside the project folder, and add each directory to backup, one per line. No slashes at the end!

Easy as pie! ü•ß
